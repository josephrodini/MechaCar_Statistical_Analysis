# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Analysis of car data in R

## Overview

This analysis was performed to help AutosRUs make more sound decisions concerning their future automobile launches by looking at previously collected data. First, it is hoped that a multiple regression will help AutosRUs better understand what car features affect the MPG of future prototypes, Next, after synthesizing data on suspension coils across various lots, it is hoped that t-tests will help determine if said lots differ in PSI from the overall population. Finally, a new study will be proposed to compare performance of MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The alternative hypothesis that the factors of vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and all wheel drive status would affect a prototype car's MPG was tested via multiple linear regression. See below for results of the multiple regression conducted in R:
